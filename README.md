osgb
====

Python routines for working with grid references as defined by the Ordnance
Survey of Great Britain (OSGB).

Toby Thurston -- 31 December 2017

The functions in this module convert from OSGB grid references to and from GPS
Latitude and Longitude, using OSGB formulae and the OSTN15 data set.
Conversions are accurate to approximately +/- 1mm.  The scope of OSGB is
limited to the same coverage as the Ordnance Survey maps:  England, Wales,
Scotland, and the Isle of Man, but not Northern Ireland, nor the Channel
Islands.   

The implementation uses the Ordnance Survey's high-precision dataset called
OSTN15.  This dataset is freely available for public use, but remains Â© Crown

reserved.

The modules are designed to work with Python 2.7 or better and with Python 3.4 or better.
With Python 2, they are slightly faster than with Python 3, but the functions are,
and the results should be, identical.

# install

    python setup.py install
    python3 setup.py install

# usage

    import osgb

    (lat, lon) = osgb.grid_to_ll(324231, 432525)
    (easting, northing) = osgb.ll_to_grid(52.132341, -2.43256)

    grid_ref = osgb.format_grid(324231, 231423)
    (easting, northing) = osgb.parse_grid("TQ213455")

Each of the modules contains detailed documentation and examples in "doctest" format.

    pydoc osgb/convert.py
    pydoc osgb/gridder.py

The scripts directory contains a handy command line conversion tool.  Try

    bngl TQ 109 324
    bngl --show 51.48 0
    bngl --help

And a feature called plotmaps.py - if you have a current Tex distribution with "mpost" installed, 
this will produce a PDF of the National Grid, optionally with the outlines of all the OS maps.

    python3 scripts/plot_maps.py --series A
